# Battery-Health-Prediction-Project
This project provides a complete workflow for predicting **battery health**â€”including **State of Charge (SoC)** and **State of Health (SoH)**â€”using machine learning models trained in a Jupyter notebook and deployed through a **Streamlit dashboard**.

âœ¨ Features

ðŸ“‚ Upload your own battery dataset (CSV format).

ðŸ“Š Automatic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): summary stats, missing values, correlations.

ðŸ¤– Pre-trained models for:

Random Forest (SoC & SoH)

LSTM (SoC & SoH)

ðŸ§¾ User-friendly interface to input Current, Voltage, Temperature, and Time difference.

âš¡ Instant predictions with multiple models for comparison.

ðŸ“¦ Requirements

1.Python 3.8+

2.Streamlit

3.Pandas, NumPy

4.Scikit-learn

5.TensorFlow / Keras

6.Matplotlib, Seaborn
